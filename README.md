# Mastering Flutter State Management with Provider

State management in Flutter refers to the management of the application's state, which includes data and UI state, to ensure that the UI reflects the current state of the application. Since Flutter is a reactive framework, the UI automatically updates whenever the application's state changes.

Various methods for managing state exist in Flutter, each tailored to specific application needs. One such method is the Provider package, a widely used solution for state management.

A popular state management solution that uses the Provider package to manage state and dependencies. It is based on the InheritedWidget mechanism but provides a simpler and more efficient way to manage state and share data across the widget tree.

It uses `ChangeNotifier` and `ChangeNotifierProvider` to notify listeners when the state changes.

✔️ In the initial example, we explored a counter application with Provider, delving into state manipulation and understanding the role of ChangeNotifier. We examined the concept of global context and its functionality within the application.

✔️ In the second example, we developed a favorite items application. Utilizing ListView.builder widget, we crafted a list of products and enabled the favoriting functionality through Provider. Following the implementation of favoriting, we showcased the list of favorited items.

✔️ For the third example, we incorporated a slider widget to alter the colors of containers, employing Provider with a ChangeNotifier to manage state changes.

✔️ In the fourth instance, we delved into theme customization within the application using Provider. We established a theme class with Provider and utilized it to switch between light and dark themes seamlessly.
